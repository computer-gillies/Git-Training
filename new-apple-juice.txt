Apple juice is a fruit juice made by the maceration and pressing of an apple. 
The resulting expelled juice may be further treated by enzymatic and centrifugal clarification to remove the starch and pectin,which holds fine particulate in suspension, 
and then pasteurized for packaging in glass, metal, or aseptic processing system containers, 
or further treated by dehydration processes to a concentrate.

Due to the complex and costly equipment required to extract and clarify juice from apples in large volume, 
apple juice is normally produced commercially.
In the United States, unfiltered fresh apple juice is made by smaller operations in areas of high apple production,
in the form of unclarified apple cider.Apple juice is one of the most common fruit juices in the world, 
with world production led by China, Poland, the United States, and Germany.
