Apples used for apple juice are usually harvested between September and mid-November in the Northern Hemisphere and between February to mid-April in
the Southern Hemisphere. A common cultivar used for apple juice is the McIntosh. 
Approximately two medium McIntosh apples produce around 200 millilitres (7.0 imp fl oz; 6.8 US fl oz) of juice. 
After the apples are picked, they are washed and transported to the processing facility. 
The apples are then pressed and juiced right away to avoid spoilage.[2] Depending on the company and end-product, 
the apples can be processed in different ways before pressing. Apple juice is then filtered, 
with the number of solid particles remaining partly defining the difference between apple juice and apple cider.
In cases where the apple juice is treated enzymatically,
the typical class of enzymes used are pectinases.
