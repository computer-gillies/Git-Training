Git:

Introduction to Git:
 Git is a distributed version control system, used to manage projects. Now, what does that mean?
 So, let’s begin with first understanding, what is Git? Let us imagine that, in a certain university,
 a group of 4 computer science students are given a project in C++. They must complete the project within one month and present it.
 So, they start working on the project, and while working on it they encounter certain problems. 
 While working on their project they came up with certain updates to the project and decided to add those.
 After adding those updates they realized that their end product was a mess.
 So, their main issue was to get back to their stable version of the project.
 So, how do we solve such an issues? This is where Git comes into play. 
 All the above problems can be solved using Git to maintain the project.
 We all know about the undo feature available across the various platforms and software,
 but it is available until a certain session is going on, once the session is over, we can’t undo.
 So, Git is also something similar, it provides the undo feature for a longer time, even if the session is over.
 So, the group’s problem to get back to the original version can be easily solved using Git. This in brief is Git.
